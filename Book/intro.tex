\section{Introduction}

This series will work through some introductory material on models of computation.
There are two goals: to teach the material itself, as well as teach how to use Coq/the basic theory behind it.

You should probably be somewhat familiar with some functional programming language, though which one is probably not important.
You should also probably have some knowledge of basic math/logic, but other than that, it should be mostly self-contained.

This article will simply introduce the idea of using Coq to prove things, then doing some simple proofs involving strings to set things up for next time.

Note that the full text for all proofs are available at the GitHub repositroy: \url{https://github.com/ReedOei/FormalModelsOfComputation}.

All images of automata were generated by the website: \url{http://ivanzuzak.info/noam/webapps/fsm_simulator/}.
