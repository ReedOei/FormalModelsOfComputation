# Models of Computation

The source code for the tutorials on my [blog](http://reedoei.com/blog), a WIP series on defining the fundamentals of the theory of computation, following the topics below.

- Introduction: [Part 1](http://reedoei.com/blog?post=A%20Formal%20Introduction%20to%20Models%20of%20Computation%20in%20Coq%20%28Part%201%29)
- DFAs: [Part 2](http://reedoei.com/blog?post=A%20Formal%20Introduction%20to%20Models%20of%20Computation%20in%20Coq%20%28Part%202%29)
- NFAs (TODO)
- Regular Expressions (TODO)
- Equivalence of DFAs, NFAs, and Regular Expressions
- Proving Regularity and Irregularity of Langauges (TODO)
- DFA Minimization
- Decidability of formulas stated in terms of automata (TODO)
- Context Free Languages
