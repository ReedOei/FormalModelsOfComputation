# Models of Computation

The source code for the tutorials on my [blog](http://reedoei.com/blog), a WIP series on defining the fundamentals of the theory of computation, following the topics below.

- Introduction: [Part 1](http://reedoei.com/blog?post=intro-models-of-comp-p1)
- DFAs: [Part 2](http://reedoei.com/blog?post=intro-models-of-comp-p2)
- NFAs: [Part 3](http://reedoei.com/blog?post=intro-models-of-comp-p3)
- Proof Automation
- Regular Expressions
- Equivalence of DFAs, NFAs, and Regular Expressions
- Proving Regularity and Irregularity of Langauges
- DFA Minimization
- Decidability of formulas stated in terms of automata
- Context Free Languages
- Pushdown Automata
- Probably more
